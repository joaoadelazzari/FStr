Elastic Buckling Analysis and mode visualizer of thin-walled structures.

The FStr computer application program gives to the user an easy and an intuitive  elastic buckling analysis, through a Finite Strip Method, and its modal visualization of a thin-walled structural element. Besides the modes, the user can determinate the critical buckling load in each critical length.

2 - Click the "APPS" tab;
3 - Click on the blue button "Install App". (upper left corner of the screen);
4 - Select the "FStr - Finite Strip Computer Application Program 1.0.1.mlappinstall"
    file;
5 - Select "Install" on "Install to My Apps?" 
    In case of updating to a new version, select "Update".
    In case of downgrade to an old version, select "Downgrade".
    In case of re-install, select "Re-install".

The FStr app will be displayed alongside any other apps you might already have, and default
MATLAB apps.

Once installed, you may run the FStr program inside MATLAB.

To initialize the program, click on the app icon, and have fun with elastic buckling analysis.
