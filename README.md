## üß† What is FStr?

**FStr** is a MATLAB-based application designed for **elastic buckling analysis** of thin-walled structural members using the **Finite Strip Method (FSM)**. It offers an intuitive interface to perform simulations and visualize buckling modes in both 2D and 3D. The user can:

- Compute critical buckling loads and their corresponding member lengths;
- Visualize colorful 3D buckling mode shapes;
- Generate signature curves for comprehensive structural analysis.

### Key Features

- Uses trigonometric series in the longitudinal direction to interpolate internal solutions and accommodate diverse boundary conditions;
- Signature curve generation across a range of member lengths;
- Color-enhanced 3D buckling mode visualization;
- Developed with MATLAB App Designer, ensuring a clean and accessible GUI for research and engineering use.
